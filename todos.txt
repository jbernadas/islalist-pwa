CRITICAL (Fix Before Testing)

  | Issue                     | Location                                | Risk                            |
  |---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
  | No API rate limiting      | Auth endpoints vulnerable               | Brute force attacks             |
  | Broad exception handling  | 48+ except Exception: blocks            | Masks bugs, poor error tracking |
  | Console.log in production | 82+ debug statements in frontend        | Information leakage             |

  IMPORTANT (For Stable Testing)

  | Issue                       | Description                                               |
  |-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
  | Missing input validation    | Image size/type validation only in views, not serializers |
  | No email verification check | If email backend not configured, fails silently           |
  | No CORS validation          | If env var empty in prod, CORS fails silently             |
  | Minimal test coverage       | Only filtering tests exist (~10% coverage)                |

  RECOMMENDED PRIORITY ORDER

  Week 1 - Critical Security:
  1. Rotate exposed credentials, remove .env from git history
  2. Add API rate limiting (DRF throttling)
  3. Replace broad exceptions with specific ones + logging
  4. Clean console statements from frontend

  Week 2 - Stability:
  1. Add test coverage for auth and listing endpoints
  2. Add input validation in serializers
  3. Set up proper error logging/monitoring
  4. Add API documentation (Swagger)
